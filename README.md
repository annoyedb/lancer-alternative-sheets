# Lancer Alternative Sheets
This is a module for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) and the [unofficial Lancer game system](https://github.com/Eranziel/foundryvtt-lancer) to provide alternative player-directed sheets for the tabletop game Lancer by Massif Press.

## Building
This module uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) to build package the module. Currently the environment is not set up to make use of hot-reloading features.

Included is a (probably) outdated bunch of type definitions generated from [foundryvtt-lancer](https://github.com/Eranziel/foundryvtt-lancer), but aside from some globally defined constants I haven't found a way to get Vite to roll-up the definitions in a working build.

Contact me if you know how. :eye::lips::eye:

## Installation
This module can be installed using the Foundry module installer.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and issues can be posted here or tagging me (`annoying`) in the Lancer Discord (AKA Pilot NET).

Please take a look at the [change log](/CHANGELOG.md) to see currently the known issues first.
